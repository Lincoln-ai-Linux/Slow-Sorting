## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: 
O(n) (if the array is already sorted).

Average and Worst Case: 
O(n^2)

Space Complexity: 
O(1) (in-place).

Key Characteristics:
Stable.
Simple to implement.
Inefficient for large datasets.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
Best, Average, Worst Case: 
O(n^2)
Space Complexity: 
O(1) (in-place).

Key Characteristics:
Not stable.
Simple to implement.
Inefficient for large datasets.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time.
It takes each element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted portion.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: 
O(n) (if the array is already sorted).

Average and Worst Case: 
O(n^2)

Space Complexity: 
O(1) (in-place).

Key Characteristics:
Stable.
Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
Simple to implement.
